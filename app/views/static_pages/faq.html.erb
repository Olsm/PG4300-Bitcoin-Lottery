          The steps to join a lottery are really simple. All you need to do is:
          <ul>
            <li>Pick a lottery and decide an amount you would like to bet</li>
            <li>Send this amount to the lottery bitcoin address (Scan QR or copy address)</li>
            <li>Make sure to pay enough transaction fee to get 1 confirm before end time</li>
            <li>When transaction got 1 confirm you will have an entry</li>
          </ul>
          Please note that your bitcoin transaction must get 1 confirm before the lottery ends. <br>
          If not, your entry will not be included in the drawing.<br/>

          The API we use to process Bitcoin transactions require all transaction inputs to have at least 3 confirms before it can be sent, as a safety feature. The payment will be sent to the winner as soon as all the lottery entry transactions has gotten at least 3 confirms. This means that potentially the prize may be delayed up to 3 bitcoin confirms after it ended, which is on average 30 minutes. This can vary from seconds to hours, but rest assure the prize will be sent as soon as possible.
