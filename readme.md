## Description

**Oneliner: Jackpots on blockchain**

Bitcoin lottery is a project which addresses and battles a lot of the issues people have with the current lottery systems that have been used for so long. We aim to lower the fees of the lottery which will give people more incentive to play. A small fee can go to charity. Anonymity come first.
